This <a href="https://gitlab.com/tristan.madden/open_simplex_noise_texture_blending">Processing</a> sketch loads two
images and creates an image mask that blends them together. The transparency of the image mask is determined by 4D <a href="https://gist.github.com/KdotJPG/b1270127455a94ac5d19">Open Simplex Noise</a>, which loops perfectly.
The ffmpeg command I used to assemble the frames is:
```console
ffmpeg -i gif-%03d.png output.gif
```
