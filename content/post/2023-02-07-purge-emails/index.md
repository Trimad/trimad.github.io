## Block Unwanted Emails

**Objective:** Prevent sending or receiving emails from specific external email addresses or domains.

**Action:** Navigate to the Tenant Allow/Block List in the Microsoft Security Center. Configure the settings to block specific email addresses or domains. For direct access, use this link: [Tenant Allow/Block List](https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList).

## Review Past Week of Sign-In History

**Objective:** Review sign-in history to identify any unusual user activity.

**Action:** Access the Azure portal's sign-in history section. Specify the user of interest and examine their sign-in locations and activities. Access the portal here: [Azure Sign-In History](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_UsersAndTenants/UserManagementMenuBlade/~/SignIns).

## Define Content Search Criteria

**Objective:** Search and identify specific emails that need to be removed from your organization.

**Action:** Utilize the Content Search feature in the Microsoft Compliance center. Define your search criteria to target specific emails. Access Content Search here: [Content Search in Compliance Center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/contentsearchv2?viewid=search).

## Connect to Exchange Online Management

**Preparation:** The following steps require PowerShell. Ensure you launch `powershell_ise` with administrative privileges.

**Action:** Establish a connection to Exchange Online Management using an elevated PowerShell session.

```PowerShell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned # If not already set.
Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement # If not installed.
Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement # This is a necessary step.
Connect-IPPSSession # Launches a Modern Authentication Window.
```

## Purge Unwanted Content

**Confirmation:** Ensure that your content search in the Compliance Center is valid. If the search name isn't visible, it might still be processing.

```PowerShell
Get-ComplianceSearch | Sort-Object JobEndTime # Retrieve and sort all compliance searches by job end time.
# or
Get-ComplianceSearch -Identity "05297487" | Select-Object * # Retrieveall stats of only one content search that you know the name of.
```

**Action:** Execute a "hard delete" on the identified content based on your search.

```PowerShell
New-ComplianceSearchAction -SearchName "name_of_content_search" -Purge -PurgeType HardDelete # Perform a hard delete of the search results.
```

**Status Check:** Monitor the progress of the hard delete operation. The names of purge actions are typically appended with `_Purge`.

```PowerShell
Get-ComplianceSearchAction -Identity "name_of_content_search_Purge" | Format-List # Check the status of the purge operation.
```

**Disconnect:** End your session with Exchange Online Management.

```PowerShell
Disconnect-ExchangeOnline # Disconnect from Exchange Online Management.
```

## Check Inbox Rules

**Objective:** Review and analyze inbox rules for each user to detect any unusual or unauthorized rules.

**Action:** Run the following PowerShell script to extract inbox rules for a list of specified user email addresses.

```powershell
Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement
Connect-ExchangeOnline # Launches a Modern Authentication Window.

# Define an array of user email addresses
$userEmails = @(
    'example-one@contoso.com',
    'example-two@contoso.com',
    'example-three@contoso.com'
)
 
# Iterate through each user and retrieve their inbox rules
foreach ($userEmail in $userEmails) {
    Write-Host ("Getting inbox rules for: " + $userEmail)
    # Attempt to fetch inbox rules for each user
    try {
        $inboxRules = Get-InboxRule -Mailbox $userEmail
        if ($inboxRules) {
            Write-Host ("Inbox rules for " + $userEmail + ":")
            $inboxRules | Format-List *  # Display all properties of the inbox rules
        } else {
            Write-Host ("No inbox rules found for " + $userEmail + ".")
        }
    } catch {
        Write-Host ("Error retrieving inbox rules for " + $userEmail + ": " + $_.Exception.Message)
    }
}

```
