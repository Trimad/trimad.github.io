            This is my tentative workflow for using this repository to animate static images using a driving video.

            The logistic map is a mathematical model used to describe the population growth of a species over time. It is a simple equation that takes into account the effects of limited resources and environmental factors on population growth. The logistic map produces a pattern of population growth that exhibits chaotic behavior as the values of the model&#39;s parameters change, making it a valuable tool for studying complex systems.

            _k-means clustering_ is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells.

            The Buddhabrot fractal is a type of fractal that is generated by plotting the paths of points that escape from the Mandelbrot set. The resulting image resembles a series of intertwined spirals and branches, and is named after the shape it resembles, which is said to resemble the seated figure of Buddha. The Buddhabrot fractal is created by assigning each point in the complex plane a &#34;color&#34; based on how many times it takes for that point to escape from the Mandelbrot set, and then plotting the paths of the points that do escape. This process is repeated millions of times, resulting in a highly detailed and intricate fractal image.

            This Processing sketch loads two images and creates an image mask that blends them together. The transparency of the image mask is determined by 4D Open Simplex Noise, which loops perfectly.

            In this sketch I turned every pixel of an image into a Lorenz System. I mapped the velocity of that system to the brightness value of the pixel. This was the result. Sadly, the Processing sketch I made this with is gone forever.

            The Barnsley Fern is a fractal pattern named after British mathematician Michael Barnsley. It is generated by an iterative process that involves repeatedly applying a set of geometric transformations to a simple initial shape. The resulting fern-like pattern displays self-similarity at different scales, and has applications in computer graphics, image compression, and chaos theory.
